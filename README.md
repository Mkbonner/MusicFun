# MusicFun
Just a basic project where I try to make a program make music.

Right now it just takes in a list of numbers from the user, a scale (Major, Minor or Chromatic), and a tempo and uses that information to generate and play a melody.
Idealy, I would like to make the gui look nicer / more user friendly but it functions fine for now.
Additionally, I hope to eventually create a way to hear how certain functions in R2 sound when translated to music (given some arbitrary bounds).
